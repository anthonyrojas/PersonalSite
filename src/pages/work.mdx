# Work

Here I will list jobs that I have worked at relating to software development or using skills that relate to my degree in Computer Science. I am still relatively new to working in this field, but am looking forward to finding a place I can plant my feet in and grow. I am always open to working at a place that will challenge me and keep me busy. Knowledge, challenges, and a pleasant work environment are two very important things I look for. For a complete job history, I have provided a link to my LinkedIn profile in footer of this site. A resume may also be provided upon request.
