# Projects

During my free time and throughout my time at school, I have worked on numerous projects. I have completed these projects with the goal of gaining experience and putting my knowledge to the test. I feel it is usually not enough to read and study a concept, language, libraries, or other software development tools, so I try to use these skills and tools in a more applied fashion. Below are some projects I have worked on.
