# Education

The education I have received from school has been of great use to expand my knowledge base and find my passion for software development. Below I have listed the colleges I have attended; I have also listed select courses that I think are relevant in my education for the skills I learned. Apart from the education obtained from schools, I also utilize sites and services such as Udemy, Codecademy, YouTube, and reading both documentation and books. Software, web development, and programming are rapidly changing fields, so it is important for me to try to always stay up to date to the best of my ability.
