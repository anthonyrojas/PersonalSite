A website for cataloging recipes using Laravel, MySQL, and Blade templates. This site uses Laravel's built-in authentication modified slightly to use usernames rather than emails. Eloquent queries were used to read and write relational object data. The database was built using code-first design and the database is populated via migrations. Each user can perform CRUD operations on their own recipes, comment on recipes, and favorite recipes, essentially creating a social media site for recipes. This was deployed to a Vultr VPS.
