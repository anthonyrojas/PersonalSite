The second version of the site created for my clan on Clash Royale. The site pulls data from RoyaleAPI and generates pages that display the API data. Also has a search feature for clans and players on Clash Royale. Built with Laravel using the Blade templating system. The frontend uses Bootstrap with some custom styling. The application was deployed to a VPS on Vultr running Nginx. The Nginx server was configured to use HTTP2 when possible in order to send all assets at once and speed up load speeds and SEO.
