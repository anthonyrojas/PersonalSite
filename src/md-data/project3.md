Website built for a client's dance studio. The website provides information about different services and classes offered by the dance studio as well as the ability to sign up for classes. The classes are displayed by pulling data from a MySQL database. Scheduling of the classes is handled via PHP. Sign-ups are also stored in the database. Completely custom CSS is used; no design library was used. Deployed over FTP to an Apache server.
