Website built for displaying information about my clan on Clash Royale, as well as other data from the Clash Royale game (i.e, clans, standings, players, etc.). The server pulls data from RoyaleAPI and injects it into EJS templates that are rendered as HTML. The site uses Bootstrap with some custom styling. The server also provides account registration and management to enable users to utilize a real-time messaging service using Socket.IO. JWT authentication is used and transmitted via cookies. Deployed to Nginx server on AWS for some time.
